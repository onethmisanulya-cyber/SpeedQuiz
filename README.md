# ⚡ Speed Quiz

A real-time multiplayer quiz game that runs in the browser. One person runs the
server on their laptop and shares a link; 10–25 players join from their own
computers. No installs for players, no database, no accounts.

**Stack:** Node.js 20+, Express, Socket.IO (server-authoritative).
Frontend is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS served statically by Express — no build step.

## Install & run

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

The server listens on port 3000 by default, configurable via `PORT`:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`:

- **Create Game** — you become the host (and also a player who answers).
- **Join Game** — enter the 4-letter room code + a display name.

## Exposing the game to other devices (internet play)

Players need to reach your laptop over HTTP. The app uses only relative URLs
for Socket.IO and assets, so it works unchanged behind an HTTPS reverse proxy
or tunnel. Easiest option: Cloudflare Tunnel.

```bash
# 1. Start the game
npm start

# 2. In another terminal, expose it (no account needed for a quick tunnel)
cloudflared tunnel --url localhost:3000
```

Cloudflare prints a public URL like `https://random-words.trycloudflare.com`.
Share `https://random-words.trycloudflare.com/?room=ABCD` (or just the room
code — the host screen shows a ready-to-copy join link). Alternatives that
also work: `ngrok http 3000`.

> Everyone must use the **same** public URL (host screen included), otherwise
> the host and players end up on different servers/rooms.

## How to play

1. Host clicks **Create Game** and shares the join link / room code.
2. Players join; the host screen shows a live player list. **Start** unlocks
   with ≥ 2 players.
3. 12 questions. The host picks seconds per question when creating the game
   (10 / 15 default / 20 / 30). Type an answer, press Enter. The screen shows live
   progress (`7 / 12 answered`) and who has answered — never the answer.
   The round ends at 0 s or when everyone answers correctly.
4. Reveal (5 s): correct answer + per-question points, fastest first.
5. Leaderboard (5 s): total scores with rank changes (▲/▼).
6. Final screen: podium (top 3), full leaderboard, **Play again** for the host
   (same room, new random questions).

Host controls: **Start**, **Skip question**, **Kick player**, **End game**.
Late joiners during a game become spectators and join as players on
"Play again". If the host disconnects, the longest-connected player is
promoted to host. Refreshing keeps your name/score/streak via a token stored
in `localStorage`.

## Scoring (computed on the server only)

- Timing uses server time: `elapsed = Date.now() - questionStartTime` when
  your answer arrives.
- Correct answer: `points = max(200, 1000 − 50 × floor(elapsed / 1000))`.
  Only your first correct answer per question counts.
- Streak bonus: `+100 × (consecutive correct − 1)` — your 2nd correct answer
  in a row earns +100 extra, 3rd earns +200, etc. Any wrong answer or a
  question with no correct answer resets the streak to 0.
- Wrong answer: optional lockout, then retry until the timer ends. The host
  picks this when creating the game: none, 1 s, 2 s (default), or 3 s.
  Spam is always capped at 5 answers/second.
- The last question is worth **double** (base + streak bonus, then ×2).

## Answer matching

Both sides are normalized (lowercase, trim, collapse whitespace, strip
punctuation and diacritics) and compared against every accepted answer:

- exact match, **or**
- Levenshtein distance ≤ 1 for accepted answers ≥ 5 characters
  (so `canbera` still matches `canberra`), **or**
- numeric equality (`"1,000"` == `"1000"`).

Questions with `"exact": true` (the typing round) disable fuzzy matching —
you must type the text character-for-character (whitespace runs normalized).

## Adding questions (`questions.json`)

An array of objects:

```json
{ "type": "trivia",     "prompt": "Capital of Australia?",             "answers": ["canberra"] }
{ "type": "math",       "prompt": "17 × 6 = ?",                        "answers": ["102"] }
{ "type": "unscramble", "prompt": "Unscramble: NPELTA",                "answers": ["planet"] }
{ "type": "emoji",      "prompt": "Which movie? 🦁👑",                 "answers": ["the lion king", "lion king"] }
{ "type": "typing",     "prompt": "Type exactly: the quick brown fox", "answers": ["the quick brown fox"], "exact": true }
```

- `type` is one of `trivia`, `math`, `unscramble`, `emoji`, `typing`
  (used for the on-screen badge and for balancing the mix).
- `answers[0]` is shown as the correct answer on the reveal screen, so put
  the canonical spelling first and add common variants after it.
- `{ "generated": "math", "op": "mul2x1" }` entries make the server invent a
  fresh random arithmetic question at runtime. Available ops: `mul2x1`
  (two-digit × one-digit), `add2`, `sub3x2`, `mul1`, `mixed`.
- Each game picks 12 questions at random with a roughly even mix of types and
  no repeats. Ship at least ~12 per type if you want every type in every game.

Restart the server after editing `questions.json`.

## Project layout

```
server.js              # Express + Socket.IO, all game logic
questions.json         # question bank
public/index.html      # landing: Create Game / Join Game
public/host.html       # host screen (also plays)
public/player.html     # player screen
public/app.css, public/host.js, public/player.js
README.md
```

## Robustness notes

- Room codes: 4 uppercase letters, no ambiguous characters (no O/I).
- Rooms are in-memory and deleted after being empty for 5 minutes.
- Every socket event is validated (room exists, correct phase, string lengths
  capped); answers outside the question phase are ignored; answers are
  rate-limited to 5/second per player.
